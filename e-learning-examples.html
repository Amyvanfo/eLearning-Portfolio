<h3> Addressing the learner's needs with a Just-in time tool</h3>
    <p>I taught a developmental English course at the community college level. In my first quarter of this teaching assignment, my learning objectives included outcomes to help students practice communicating clearly and to become familiar with the style and conventions of academic writing.
 In my post class reflection and improvement process, I added to the learning objectives some of the skills they would need to be able to feel confident in their next writing or composition course. To be successful in college, students needed to become comfortable using computer skills to prepare a paper. So, one skill that I taught in class was how to set paper in MLA style in a Word document. For some students, this was new to them, so they needed to review the skill and go slowly.  I found myself repeating this information so often, that I created this How To screen capture and posted it to YouTube so they could view it whenever they needed to and that it would be available to them even after my course was completed.</p>
