   <h3> Setting Expectations with a Kickoff Meeting</h3>
       <p>You’ve got a request for training to put in the LMS. The requester has a strong justification for needing the training and you’re ready to talk about timelines, expectation and scope for the project.
I’ve created this simple table that will help you to inform your SME about what steps are required to produce high quality, effective training. I use this tool to guide that conversation. They are often surprised at how long it takes and what is involved. This is an opportunity to evaluate whether eLearning will meet their needs and even if there are adequate resources available to meet the training needs of the organization.
